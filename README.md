Project 6
This dataset contains responses from 10 participants who were asked to approximate their agreement with three different approaches to feminism: difference-denying, difference-removing, and difference-honoring. Participants were asked to rate their degree of agreement with each approach on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 represents "strongly disagree" and 10 represents "strongly agree". They were also asked to indicate which approach they believe has had the most cultural and political impact in the past few decades, regardless of whether they personally agree with it or not. Additionally, participants were asked whether they are or have been a mother, and their age, gender, and occupation were recorded.
